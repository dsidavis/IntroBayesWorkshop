# Resources for learning Bayesian data analysis techniques

## Packages

### Multi-interface

+ [Stan](mc-stan.org): Implements Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, with
  interfaces for R, Python, Julia, Matlab, command line, etc.
  
+ [JAGS](http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/): Tried and true Gibbs
  sampler with interfaces to many languages. Uses similar syntax as
  the older BUGS and Win-BUGS.

### R

+ [NIMBLE](https://r-nimble.org/): Uses BUGS-style language while
  implementing newer sampler techniques and compiled code for speed.
  
+ [greta](https://greta-dev.github.io/greta/): Newer package with
  Google Tensorflow behind the scenes. Currently lacking many features.

### Python

+ [Edward](http://edwardlib.org/): Allows both Bayesian statistics and
  common machine learning tasks.
  
+ [PyMC3](http://docs.pymc.io/):


### Julia

+ [Mamba](https://mambajl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/):

## Text books

+ [Bayesian Data Analysis, 3rd
  ed.](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/): Also known as
  BDA3. Widely considered
  the definitive text for Bayesian analysis, it is comprehensive and
  detailed.
  
+ [Statistical
  Rethinking](http://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/): Easily
  approachable introduction to Bayesian analysis. Lots of supplemental
  materials available, including lectures and people on UCD campus who
  have taken and even TA'ed for Richard.
  
+ [Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical
  Models](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/): Uses both
  Bayesian and frequentist statistics. More easily approached than
  BDA3, while covering many of the same topics. Due for a refresh
  using latest technologies.
